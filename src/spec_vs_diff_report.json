  "summary": "REQ-43 and REQ-44 appear implemented by switching the predictions refetch interval to a shared 30-minute constant and applying it on both the predictions list and prediction detail queries. Premium/terms gating wrappers are still present in the modified pages. The diff also introduces a live-scores refetch constant (1s) which was not requested and could imply a live-score cadence change (though the actual polling change is not directly shown).",

    {
      "description": "Added a shared LIVE_SCORES_REFETCH_INTERVAL_MS constant (1 second) even though the request explicitly did not ask to change or rework live-score polling cadence.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest is limited to changing predictions refresh cadence only; adding a live-score interval constant is extra surface area and may indicate an unrequested live-score polling adjustment.",
