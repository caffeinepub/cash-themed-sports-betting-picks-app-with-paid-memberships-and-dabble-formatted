  "summary": "REQ-21 and REQ-22 appear implemented via a new global fixed cash-themed gradient background applied to the body (light/dark variants) and an updated HeroBranding overlay using the existing cash pattern asset with stronger opacity and green/gold gradients. AppLayout now enforces full-viewport height via min-h-screen. There are also some additional, unrequested landing-page visual tweaks (card borders/icons).",
